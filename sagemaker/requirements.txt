# SageMaker Training Dependencies
# CHB-MIT EEG Seizure Analysis
#
# NOTE: The sklearn container already has all ML dependencies:
# - numpy==1.24.1, scipy==1.8.0, scikit-learn==1.2.1, pandas==1.1.3
#
# pyedflib is installed in the training script with --no-deps
# to avoid pulling in incompatible numpy versions.
